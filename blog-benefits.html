    <p>While CPS (Clicks Per Second) and spacebar games may seem simple, they actually provide several benefits beyond entertainment.</p>

    <h2>1. Improved Reaction Time</h2>
    <p>Fast tapping exercises your brain’s ability to react quickly, which can translate into better reflexes in other games and daily activities.</p>

    <h2>2. Hand-Eye Coordination</h2>
    <p>Pressing the spacebar rapidly while watching a timer improves coordination and muscle memory.</p>

    <h2>3. Stress Relief</h2>
    <p>These games act as quick stress relievers. A few minutes of hitting the spacebar can release tension and boost energy.</p>

    <h2>4. Competitive Fun</h2>
    <p>CPS games add a fun competitive element. Players enjoy comparing scores with friends and trying to break personal records.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>CPS and spacebar games are not just for fun—they also enhance focus, coordination, and relieve stress, making them a great daily activity.</p>
