    <p>If you’re serious about achieving high CPS (Clicks Per Second) scores, having the right keyboard can make a huge difference. Not all keyboards are built for speed, so let’s explore the best options.</p>

    <h2>1. Mechanical Keyboards</h2>
    <p>Mechanical keyboards are the top choice for CPS gamers. Switches like Cherry MX Red, Blue, or Brown provide tactile feedback and fast actuation.</p>

    <h2>2. Low Profile Keyboards</h2>
    <p>Low profile switches reduce the travel distance, meaning less effort per keypress. This can help you achieve higher CPS with less strain.</p>

    <h2>3. Keyboards with Anti-Ghosting</h2>
    <p>Ghosting occurs when multiple keypresses are not registered. A gaming keyboard with anti-ghosting ensures all your clicks count.</p>

    <h2>4. Compact Keyboards</h2>
    <p>60% or TKL (Tenkeyless) keyboards are lightweight and allow more comfortable hand positioning for long CPS sessions.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right keyboard depends on your comfort and play style. A mechanical keyboard is generally the best investment for serious CPS players.</p>
