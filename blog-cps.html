    <p>Clicks Per Second (CPS) is a measure of how many times you can press a key, usually the spacebar or mouse button, in one second. Many gamers compete to achieve high CPS scores, and it’s a fun way to test speed and accuracy.</p>

    <h2>1. Use Proper Finger Technique</h2>
    <p>The fastest players usually use two fingers alternating rapidly on the spacebar. This reduces strain and increases speed compared to using only one finger.</p>

    <h2>2. Try Butterfly and Jitter Clicking</h2>
    <p>Butterfly clicking involves tapping with two fingers alternately, while jitter clicking uses quick muscle vibrations. Both methods can improve CPS significantly, but they require practice.</p>

    <h2>3. Get a Responsive Keyboard</h2>
    <p>Not all keyboards are created equal. Mechanical keyboards, especially with red or blue switches, are much faster and more responsive for CPS tests than regular membrane keyboards.</p>

    <h2>4. Practice Daily</h2>
    <p>Consistency is the key. Even just 5 minutes of daily practice on Hitbar can help you see major improvements in your score within a week.</p>

    <h2>5. Track Your Progress</h2>
    <p>Keep testing yourself on Hitbar and record your scores. Over time, you’ll notice your CPS improving if you stick with the practice.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Improving CPS is a mix of technique, equipment, and regular practice. Use the methods above, and challenge your friends to see who can become the fastest player!</p>
